Over the years, I found myself enjoying cigars more often, and I disliked going to cigar shops everytime I wanted a cigar and buying just one or two singles. I was in law school when I began experimenting with cigars, so I was on a buget. I invested in a cheap, glasstop humidor I purchased online. I read about how to properly season my new humidor and set about preparing my new humidor. After a few weeks, the humidity stabilized and I placed my new cigars in the humidor. Only two days later, the humidity plumeted and could not recover. After many attempts to keep the humidity at acceptable levels, I gave up. I resorted to using a few small "tupperdors.""

With tupperdors, I had the opposite problem, I could not keep the humidity down even with regulating packets or humidity beads; this was due to the perfect seal and glass container not absorbing any excess moisture.

I begand researching for a new humidor, I loved the look of the glass top because I could see the cigars, and, more importantly, I could check the calibrated hygrometer without opening the humidor. Alas, due to the known issues on glasstop humidors, I decided to go with a solid humidor. However, I still wanted to be able to monitor the humidity and temperature without frequently opening the humidor. 

I had always wanted to develop a project utilizing a Raspberry Pi, and this proved to be an excellent first project. I decided I was going to build a temperature/humidity sensor that would allow me to acurately monitor the status of my humidor without opening it. Additionally, now the temperature/humidity monitor could be networked, allowing me to check from anywhere I had an internet connection (overkill, but fun nonetheless).

Concept

Initially, the project started with researching the advantages or disadvantages of building from the Arduino or Raspberry Pi platform.
